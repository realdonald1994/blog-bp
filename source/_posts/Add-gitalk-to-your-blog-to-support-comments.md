`gitalk` is a modern comment component based on GitHub Issue and Preact. You can integrate gitalk to your blog to support `comments`.

## Create a repo on GitHub to store comments

For example, I create a repo named blog-comments.

Remember to enable issues in the setting page of this repo.

## Register an OAuth application on GitHub
This application will be used by `gitalk`.

Remember to enter you blog url in item Homepage URL and AUthorization callback URL.

Copy Client ID and Client Secret. You can also check your application at 
[https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers).

## Configure Hexo
> Create file `comment.ejs` in folder `themes/me/layout_partial`
```javascript
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gitalk@1/dist/gitalk.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gitalk@1/dist/gitalk.min.js"></script>
<div id="gitalk-container"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    var gitalk = new Gitalk({
        clientID: '<%= theme.gitalk.clientID %>',
        clientSecret: '<%= theme.gitalk.clientSecret %>',
        id: window.location.pathname,
        repo: '<%= theme.gitalk.repo %>',
        owner: '<%= theme.gitalk.owner %>',
        admin: '<%= theme.gitalk.admin %>'
    })
    gitalk.render('gitalk-container')
</script>
```

Note if your theme differs mine, you may need to find proper location to store `comment.ejs`.

> Embed `comment.js` in your `post.ejs` file
```ejs
<%# gitalk comments %>
   <%if(theme.gitalk.enable){%>
       <%- partial('_partial/comment') %>
<%}%>
```

> Configure gitalk parameters in `_config.yml`
```yaml
# gittalk comments
gitalk:
  enable: true
  owner: your-github-username # github username
  repo: blog-comments # repo name to store comments
  admin: your-github-username # owner of repo above
  clientID: your-client-id  # application id and secret
  clientSecret: your-client-secret
```

After publish, you need to login with your GitHub account at the bottom of the current post, then youâ€™ll find you (and other users) can comment your blog. All comments will be stored under `issues` of your branch `blog-comments`.
